todo :
- finish middle button drag scrolling, x and y ( cscroll_mbutton_scroll )
- make fps update in realtime instead of only while hovering ( issue with drawing being in window procedure )
- run another performance profile for instrumentation and reduce calls with extra logic if possible
- - extern wnd_sz and pwnd_sz and reduce calculation to : wm_size message, on first loop to set, any resizing event in wnd_resize & wnd_drag
- add menu bar & functionality + keybinds ( wnd_type -> editproc -> wm_keydown )
- - make "one time renderer" so you pass info and it draws itself
