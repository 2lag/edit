todo :
- fix drop downs hiding on mouse move
- - maybe just make it so you press ctrl+ a key after pressing the dropdown
- - maybe do the same for the base so we can remove clicking all together
- do macro sub-drop down ( clear | record | playback )
- make keybinds for menu ( wnd_type -> editproc -> wm_keydown )
- fix not being able to full screen drag on vert monitor ( wnd_drag.cpp )
- minimize var scope | const vars | clean, optimize, and create files ( make file checklist )
- - reduce setcursor calls
- add ss and make documentation
