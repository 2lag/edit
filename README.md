todo :
- check textoutw calls make sure its justified
- - between line count and fps, this actually seems the most reasonable
- check getclientrect/fillrect/get|releaseDC/settxt|setbk/line_count/load_cursor individually for each section
- - make sure theyre only called when needed, 100% extra logic can be added to reduce the amount of calls
- add menu bar & functionality + keybinds ( wnd_type -> editproc -> wm_keydown )
- - make "one time renderer" so you pass info and it draws itself
- - - file
- - - tools
- - - - macro
- - - - - clear
- - - - - - wipes macro storage
- - - - - record
- - - - - - store keypresses in array/vector ?

- - - - - - plays back keypresses
- - - - mutli-cursor
- - - style cfg controller ( extern globalize these settings )
