- make openproc append the opened file text to current text, inverted to how saveproc appends the path to the beginning
- globalize prev window size, window pos, prev window pos, ( mouse pos, prev mouse pos ( global & make func to convert to local ) ) ( avoids recomputation/recalling )

- enable better optimization in compiling settings if possible
- plan functionality for :
- - - Find
- - - Replace
- - - Macro
- - - multi-Cursor
- - - Scripts ( /scripts/*.edit in cfg dir )

- full, final, in-depth reoptimization
