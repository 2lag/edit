todo :
- make fps update in realtime instead of only while hovering ( issue with peekmessage loop fml )
- run another performance profile for instrumentation and reduce calls with extra logic if possible
- - also find a way to see what functions are called where "[External Code]" is to change to lower-level or different call
- add menu bar & functionality + keybinds ( wnd_type -> editproc -> wm_keydown )
- - make "one time renderer" so you pass info and it draws itself
- - - file
- - - tools
- - - - macro
- - - - mutli-cursor
- - - style cfg controller
- - - - hide fps
- - - - hide caret pos
- - - - hide line count
- minimize var scope | const vars | clean, optimize, and create files ( make file checklist ) |
- add picture and documentation here
