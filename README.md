todo :
- from performance profiler, focus on reducing the following calls :
- - gettextextentpoint
- - - save to static unless for variable word size usage
- - textoutw
- - - between line count and fps, this actually seems the most reasonable
- - fillrect/get|releaseDC/settxt|setbk/line_count/load_cursor
- - - make sure theyre only called when needed, 100% extra logic can be added to reduce the amount of calls
- add menu bar & functionality + keybinds ( wnd_type -> editproc -> wm_keydown )
- - make "one time renderer" so you pass info and it draws itself
- - - file
- - - tools
- - - - macro
- - - - - clear
- - - - - - wipes macro storage
- - - - - record
- - - - - - store keypresses in array/vector ?
- - - - - playback
- - - - - - plays back keypresses
- - - - mutli-cursor
- - - style cfg controller ( extern globalize these settings )
- - - - hide fps
- - - - hide caret pos
- - - - hide line count
- minimize var scope | const vars | clean, optimize, and create files ( make file checklist )
- add ss and make documentation
